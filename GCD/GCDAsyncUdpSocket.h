/**
 * You may optionally set a receive filter for the socket.
 * A filter can provide several useful features:
 *    
 * 1. Many times udp packets need to be parsed.
 *    Since the filter can run in its own independent queue, you can parallelize this parsing quite easily.
 *    The end result is a parallel socket io, datagram parsing, and packet processing.
 * 
 * 2. Many times udp packets are discarded because they are duplicate/unneeded/unsolicited.
 *    The filter can prevent such packets from arriving at the delegate.
 *    And because the filter can run in its own independent queue, this doesn't slow down the delegate.
 * 
 *    - Since the udp protocol does not guarantee delivery, udp packets may be lost.
 *      Many protocols built atop udp thus provide various resend/re-request algorithms.
 *      This sometimes results in duplicate packets arriving.
 *      A filter may allow you to architect the duplicate detection code to run in parallel to normal processing.
 *    
 *    - Since the udp socket may be connectionless, its possible for unsolicited packets to arrive.
 *      Such packets need to be ignored.
 * 
 * 3. Sometimes traffic shapers are needed to simulate real world environments.
 *    A filter allows you to write custom code to simulate such environments.
 *    The ability to code this yourself is especially helpful when your simulated environment
 *    is more complicated than simple traffic shaping (e.g. simulating a cone port restricted router),
 *    or the system tools to handle this aren't available (e.g. on a mobile device).
 * 
 * @param data    - The packet that was received.
 * @param address - The address the data was received from.
 *                  See utilities section for methods to extract info from address.
 * @param context - Out parameter you may optionally set, which will then be passed to the delegate method.
 *                  For example, filter block can parse the data and then,
 *                  pass the parsed data to the delegate.
 * 
 * @returns - YES if the received packet should be passed onto the delegate.
 *            NO if the received packet should be discarded, and not reported to the delegete.
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * GCDAsyncUdpSocketReceiveFilterBlock filter = ^BOOL (NSData *data, NSData *address, id *context) {
 * 
 *     MyProtocolMessage *msg = [MyProtocol parseMessage:data];
 *

 * };
 * [udpSocket setReceiveFilter:filter withQueue:myParsingQueue];

/**
 * You may optionally set a receive filter for the socket.
 * This receive filter may be set to run in its own queue (independent of delegate queue).
 * 
 * A filter can provide several useful features.
 * 
 * 1. Many times udp packets need to be parsed.
 *    Since the filter can run in its own independent queue, you can parallelize this parsing quite easily.
 *    The end result is a parallel socket io, datagram parsing, and packet processing.
 * 
 * 2. Many times udp packets are discarded because they are duplicate/unneeded/unsolicited.
 *    The filter can prevent such packets from arriving at the delegate.
 *    And because the filter can run in its own independent queue, this doesn't slow down the delegate.
 * 
 *    - Since the udp protocol does not guarantee delivery, udp packets may be lost.
 *      Many protocols built atop udp thus provide various resend/re-request algorithms.
 *      This sometimes results in duplicate packets arriving.
 *      A filter may allow you to architect the duplicate detection code to run in parallel to normal processing.
 *    
 *    - Since the udp socket may be connectionless, its possible for unsolicited packets to arrive.
 *      Such packets need to be ignored.
 * 
 * 3. Sometimes traffic shapers are needed to simulate real world environments.
 *    A filter allows you to write custom code to simulate such environments.
 *    The ability to code this yourself is especially helpful when your simulated environment
 *    is more complicated than simple traffic shaping (e.g. simulating a cone port restricted router),
 *    or the system tools to handle this aren't available (e.g. on a mobile device).
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * GCDAsyncUdpSocketReceiveFilterBlock filter = ^BOOL (NSData *data, NSData *address, id *context) {
 * 
 *     MyProtocolMessage *msg = [MyProtocol parseMessage:data];
 *     
 *     *context = response;
 *     return (response != nil);
 * };
 * [udpSocket setReceiveFilter:filter withQueue:myParsingQueue];
 * 
 * For more information about GCDAsyncUdpSocketReceiveFilterBlock, see the documentation for its typedef.
 * To remove a previously set filter, invoke this method and pass a nil filterBlock and NULL filterQueue.
 * 
 * Note: This method invokes setReceiveFilter:withQueue:isAsynchronous: (documented below),
 *       passing YES for the isAsynchronous parameter.

#pragma mark Advanced
/**
 * GCDAsyncSocket maintains thread safety by using an internal serial dispatch_queue.
 * In most cases, the instance creates this queue itself.
 * However, to allow for maximum flexibility, the internal queue may be passed in the init method.
 * This allows for some advanced options such as controlling socket priority via target queues.
 * However, when one begins to use target queues like this, they open the door to some specific deadlock issues.
 *
 * For example, imagine there are 2 queues:
 * dispatch_queue_t socketQueue;
 * dispatch_queue_t socketTargetQueue;
 *
 * If you do this (pseudo-code):
 * socketQueue.targetQueue = socketTargetQueue;
 *
 * Then all socketQueue operations will actually get run on the given socketTargetQueue.
 * This is fine and works great in most situations.
 * But if you run code directly from within the socketTargetQueue that accesses the socket,
 * you could potentially get deadlock. Imagine the following code:
 *
 * - (BOOL)socketHasSomething
 * {
 *     __block BOOL result = NO;
 *     dispatch_block_t block = ^{
 *         result = [self someInternalMethodToBeRunOnlyOnSocketQueue];
 *     }
 *     if (is_executing_on_queue(socketQueue))
 *         block();
 *     else
 *         dispatch_sync(socketQueue, block);
 *
 *     return result;
 * }
 *
 * What happens if you call this method from the socketTargetQueue? The result is deadlock.
 * This is because the GCD API offers no mechanism to discover a queue's targetQueue.
 * Thus we have no idea if our socketQueue is configured with a targetQueue.
 * If we had this information, we could easily avoid deadlock.
 * But, since these API's are missing or unfeasible, you'll have to explicitly set it.
 *
 * IF you pass a socketQueue via the init method,
 * AND you've configured the passed socketQueue with a targetQueue,
 * THEN you should pass the end queue in the target hierarchy.
 *
 * For example, consider the following queue hierarchy:
 * socketQueue -> ipQueue -> moduleQueue
 *
 * This example demonstrates priority shaping within some server.
 * All incoming client connections from the same IP address are executed on the same target queue.
 * And all connections for a particular module are executed on the same target queue.
 * Thus, the priority of all networking for the entire module can be changed on the fly.
 * Additionally, networking traffic from a single IP cannot monopolize the module.
 *
 * Here's how you would accomplish something like that:
 * - (dispatch_queue_t)newSocketQueueForConnectionFromAddress:(NSData *)address onSocket:(GCDAsyncSocket *)sock
 * {
 *     dispatch_queue_t socketQueue = dispatch_queue_create("", NULL);
 *     dispatch_queue_t ipQueue = [self ipQueueForAddress:address];
 *
 *     dispatch_set_target_queue(socketQueue, ipQueue);
 *     dispatch_set_target_queue(iqQueue, moduleQueue);
 *
 *     return socketQueue;
 * }
 * - (void)socket:(GCDAsyncSocket *)sock didAcceptNewSocket:(GCDAsyncSocket *)newSocket
 * {
 *     [clientConnections addObject:newSocket];
 *     [newSocket markSocketQueueTargetQueue:moduleQueue];
 * }
 *
 * Note: This workaround is ONLY needed if you intend to execute code directly on the ipQueue or moduleQueue.
 * This is often NOT the case, as such queues are used solely for execution shaping.

/**
 * It's not thread-safe to access certain variables from outside the socket's internal queue.
 * 
 * For example, the socket file descriptor.
 * File descriptors are simply integers which reference an index in the per-process file table.
 * However, when one requests a new file descriptor (by opening a file or socket),
 * the file descriptor returned is guaranteed to be the lowest numbered unused descriptor.
 * So if we're not careful, the following could be possible:
 * 
 * - Thread A invokes a method which returns the socket's file descriptor.
 * - The socket is closed via the socket's internal queue on thread B.
 * - Thread C opens a file, and subsequently receives the file descriptor that was previously the socket's FD.
 * - Thread A is now accessing/altering the file instead of the socket.
 * 
 * In addition to this, other variables are not actually objects,
 * and thus cannot be retained/released or even autoreleased.
 * An example is the sslContext, of type SSLContextRef, which is actually a malloc'd struct.
 * 
 * Although there are internal variables that make it difficult to maintain thread-safety,
 * it is important to provide access to these variables
 * to ensure this class can be used in a wide array of environments.
 * This method helps to accomplish this by invoking the current block on the socket's internal queue.
 * The methods below can be invoked from within the block to access
 * those generally thread-unsafe internal variables in a thread-safe manner.
 * The given block will be invoked synchronously on the socket's internal queue.
