	// 
	// Lumberjack is a professional logging framework. It's extremely fast and flexible.
	// It also uses GCD, making it a great fit for GCDAsyncSocket.
	// 
	// As mentioned earlier, enabling logging in GCDAsyncSocket is entirely optional.
	// Doing so simply helps give you a deeper understanding of the inner workings of the library (if you care).
	// You can do so at the top of GCDAsyncSocket.m,
	// where you can also control things such as the log level,
	// and whether or not logging should be asynchronous (helps to improve speed, and
	// perfect for reducing interference with those pesky timing bugs in your code).
	// 
	// There is a massive amount of documentation on the Lumberjack project page:
	// http://code.google.com/p/cocoalumberjack/
	// 
	// But this one line is all you need to instruct Lumberjack to spit out log statements to the Xcode console.
